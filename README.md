# Friends of Friends

Test-Drive Neo4j with Cypher while using the Neo4j Languages drivers from different programming languages. We would like
to think that programming languages are like friends so we will take a look at how we can interact with the friends graph
using the Neo4j drivers for the following programming languages:- Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.

# Setup

This setup applies to all the sample programs.

1. Copy example config yaml file
2. Edit all the keys in the config.yml file to match your environment.

```bash
cp config.yml.example config.yml
```
